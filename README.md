# call_maths_operations_using_delegates

This C# Program Calls Math Operations using Delegates. Here the Delegates are used to encapsulate functions into callable function objects that are used much as function pointers are used in C, C++, and other languages. Like function pointers, delegates enable you to separate a function reference from its implementation, allowing the implementation to exist in a separate module.
